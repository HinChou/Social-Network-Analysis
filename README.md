# Social-Network-Analysis(SNA)

Social network analysis paves the way for people to obtain both visual and mathematical analysis of complex interactions in systems that involve entities(eg: human). With a combination of data mining and extraction it is possible to decompose large volumes of data and make connections previously unseen, with the goal of obtaining valuable information from the data.
